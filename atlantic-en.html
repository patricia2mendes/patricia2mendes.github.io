									<p>I had the privilege of working closely to a company since its foundation which strengthened up my professional experience in many areas. I would also like to emphasise that the team I worked with was multigenerational and multinational, aspects that I greatly value due to the diversity of inputs.</p>
									<p>Local creation, global admiration: a start-up that helps Madeiran artisans market their art pieces globally. It involves a rigorous research process, working with people from different backgrounds, thus creating a very strong social bond. This objective is, in my opinion, key to the success of any company today: concern for people.</p>
									<p>At the company, we have always aimed to create a self-sustaining 'social ecosystem' in which artisans focus on their dreams: producing their art pieces. Thus, in a preliminary phase, we were faced with consulting the artisans (optimising processes, innovative ideas aligned with the market...) and analysing the quality of the products themselves. As part of its business model, ARTLANTIC orders, buys and/or resells its products to B2B clients (e.g. hotels, wine companies, etc.) or B2C clients on the marketplace (Etsy and others).</p>
									<p>In addition to this commercial aspect, of course, the products had to be well represented. To make this happen, we hired a South African photographer, and I prepared the design of some booklets to add to the final packaging and allow the products to 'tell' their story. At the end, it is all about spreading the story and de work of local artisans from Madeira Island.</p>
